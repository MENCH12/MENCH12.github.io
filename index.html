        <div class="about-me">
            <p>Hello there! My name is Brad, and I am currently nearing the completion of a software development program at NBCC in Fredericton, NB. While I'm still building my professional experience, my journey in tech began in my teenage years with modifying video game consoles. This early interest sparked a lifelong passion for working with computers and technology. Below, I've highlighted some of the key skills I've developed over the years, both through self-learning and my recent academic pursuits at college. I'm excited to continue expanding this skill set in the near future!</p>

        <p>           
            As a recent graduate, I've spent the last three years immersing myself in the world of software development and web design. My journey has been marked by significant learning experiences, as reflected in my grades: a 98% in Responsive Web Design, focusing on HTML and CSS, and a 98% in Advanced SQL. I have explored both introductory and advanced JavaScript courses, building a solid understanding of the language. Additionally, I've developed skills in C#, Java, and PHP, which have been instrumental in creating various object-oriented applications. On this portfolio webpage, you'll find a selection of projects I completed during my time at NBCC, complete with screenshots and explanations, showcasing my development as a programmer and designer. </p>

                <h3>JavaFX Calculator</h3>
        <p>
            For my portfolio, I've chosen to highlight the cleanest and most efficient code I developed during my academic tenure. Featured here is the final project from my Introduction to Java course: a fully functioning JavaFX Calculator. This program isn't just limited to basic calculations; it also efficiently performs square root and reciprocal calculations. This project exemplifies not only my technical skills in Java but also my ability to create practical, user-friendly applications. </p>

                <h3>JavaJam</h3>
        <p>This project showcased is the midterm for my PHP course. While I must credit my teacher for the CSS and page design, the core of the project is a web application for an imaginary coffee shop. My role was focused on the backend coding, specifically developing a system that captures user input and integrates it seamlessly into the site's database. This efficient and functional backend design earned me a 98% on this assignment, demonstrating my proficiency in PHP and database management. </p>
